# Hand Gesture Recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe

## Project Overview
This project is a hand gesture recognition system built using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It allows users to control and interact with their computers through simple hand gestures. The system captures a video stream from a webcam, detects hand landmarks, and recognizes specific hand gestures, mapping them to corresponding emojis.

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture recognition.
- Supports gestures like "Index Finger Up", "Thumbs Up", "Thumbs Down", and "Middle Finger".
- Displays corresponding emojis for recognized gestures in the console.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

## Getting Started
